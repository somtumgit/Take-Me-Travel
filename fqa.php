              How does the process work?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Maybe you know exactly where you want to go. Or maybe you only know when you’ll be able to travel. Whatever the case may be, we are here to help create an unforgettable journey built precisely around your needs and interests. Our travel consultants are authorities on their destinations and provide you with exceptional options based on who you are and what you hope to experience. Our goal is to make the planning process as seamless and enjoyable as your trip.</p>

              <div class="head1">Step 1: Discussing your Destination & Sample Pricing</div>
              <p> Our website lists sample itineraries to many of our favorite destinations, and many of our travelers take these programs “as is.” Our sample itineraries provide an example of what is possible in a destination and also give an idea of the cost for a private program in a particular destination. However, if you are looking to make a few changes here or there, or wish to have a fully customized itinerary, we are thrilled to assist you.</p>

              <div class="head1">Step 2: Developing a Custom Itinerary & Specific Pricing</div>
              <p>Once you decide to move forward and would like us to develop a more customized itinerary with specific pricing, we ask that new travelers pay a consulting fee for this proposal.* (If you travel with us, this amount will be applied to your final invoice.) At this point, your travel consultant will complete a more detailed, customized itinerary and provide pricing based on your specific travel dates and arrangements. *Once you become a <a href="#" class="sub1">Selkirk Society</a> member (an R. Crusoe past traveler), this consulting fee is waived. </p>

              <div class="head1">Step 3: Finalizing your Program</div>
              <p>After consulting with you, we will request your final approval of the customized proposal. A deposit will then be requested to reserve space and confirm all arrangements for your trip. We will provide you with the necessary documents and checklists to help you prepare for your journey. </p>

              Is it possible to customize the itineraries listed on your site?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Yes. The itineraries on our site are sample journeys that include the best of the best in every destination. But they are only a starting point. We are experts at creating unusual, luxury vacations just for you based on your wants, your interests, your dreams, and your schedule. If you tell us what you’re hoping for, we will work with you to create a truly customized, private journey. The possibilities are endless. Please note that our private journeys require a minimum of five days of accommodations and escorted sightseeing.</p>

              How will we communicate with you while planning our itinerary?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Just as our journeys are customized, so are our conversations with you. We will work with you in whatever way you choose — typically that means over the phone and/or by email. It is important to us to respect your time and preferences, so we will help you plan your trip in the format that is best for you.</p>

              Do you have set departure dates for your trips?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Since our journeys are created especially for you, they can begin any day you choose. They are private tours arranged just for you and your traveling companion(s). The only R. Crusoe tours with set departure dates are our Hosted Journeys, Private Jet Journeys, cruises, and any special interest groups that have arranged to travel with us.</p>

              What’s included in the cost of my trip?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Inclusions and exclusions vary depending on your journey, and your travel consultant will communicate these with you during planning. Typically, the following items are included in the cost of your R. Crusoe trip: private local guide(s); private ground transportation; accommodations; transfers; entrance fees; and sightseeing and meals as indicated on your itinerary. We can arrange your internal flights, but they are priced separately.<br><br>
              Items that we do not arrange and are therefore excluded from the cost of your journey include: international airfare; costs of passports and/or visas; personal expenses such as laundry; meals or beverages not listed on the itinerary; room service; excess baggage fees; communication charges; airport and port taxes; porterage; sightseeing not included on your itinerary; all gratuities; and personal insurance coverage.</p>

              Why is the price of my trip not identical to the price listed in the sample itinerary?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>We create private, customized tours that include experiences that are important to you. Because each tour we create is unique, and because rates vary depending on travel dates, we are not able to provide exact prices upfront. However, the prices listed are a good indication of what you can expect to pay. Once you begin working with a travel consultant, you will receive a more exact estimate for your journey.</p>

              Won’t a customized tour cost more than a group tour?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Not necessarily. Private travel can be more expensive (as it’s customized just for you), but you’re also receiving a personalized experience and the added value of a private guide and driver all to yourself in every destination. While the flexibility of private travel can increase some costs, it can also help reduce or eliminate other expenses. Group tours include set dining menus and some additional fixed costs which are not necessary for a private program. With R. Crusoe, you have the flexibility during the planning process to include only the meals you wish and to select the hotels and room categories of your choice.</p>

              Will I still have a guide?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Yes. All of our travelers are accompanied by hand-picked guides that are experts in their destinations. No matter if you’re traveling alone or with a large group of family or friends, we will arrange for you to have a top-notch local guide. We will also provide you with leisure time to explore on your own. This will be arranged with your travel consultant during planning.</p>

              I’m involved in an association, and we’re interested in a group travel program. Could we work with R. Crusoe & Son?
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <p>Yes, we love to work with special interest groups on extraordinary journeys that don’t have the feel of a traditional group tour. We’ve worked with orchestra and museum patrons, corporations, non-profit associations, foodies, and wine lovers to plan unique travels that fit their needs. Please call us anytime at 1-800-585-8555 to discuss your group.</p>

              <p>We want you to experience the best of what the world has to offer — and of course, that includes the weather. We’ve put together a helpful chart that will show you the best times to travel to certain destinations. But remember, these aren’t the only times to visit, they’re simply the months when the weather is most favorable. Please call us if you have more specific questions about travel to a certain destination.</p>

              <p>We can book the internal flights you take during your journey (e.g., from Buenos Aires to Mendoza); however, you are responsible for booking your overseas air travel. We’ve found that our travelers typically prefer to arrange their own flights so they can use their frequent flier miles. If you would rather have someone else arrange your airline travel, we’ve partnered with two organizations that can meet your needs.</p>

              <p>Yes. During your journey, you will have access to your local guides and our partners on the ground at all times. This is the best and most efficient means of communication while traveling. If there is a significant issue, you will be able to reach us in our Chicago office. You can communicate by email with your travel consultant while you’re traveling, and we also provide 24/7 after-hours emergency access through our main telephone number. That’s the benefit of working with R. Crusoe & Son. Should the unexpected arise, we will support you every step of the way and help make any necessary alternative arrangements.</p>
